                      IYNS, in collaboration with ITER, France, offers a unique three-week international internship for Indian school and college students.
                      This program introduces students to the world of science, with a focus on nuclear fusion. Participants will engage in workshops, training sessions, and guided site visits to the ITER reactor, 
                      gaining both theoretical and practical knowledge of its systems. 
                      While students won't be involved in radiation-related activities, they'll build global scientific 
                      connections that could shape their future careers.
